scala-test-heloworld

During Hack The Tower meetup some of the team were interested in introducing Scala into their company.

I told them the way Scala was introduced in my company.
We started doing unit, integration and functional testing in Scala for our main projects.
This way we could learn and practice while not making the businnes scary.

This project could help my Hack the Tower team members to start using Scala in their companies.
